# Fine-Tuned Hybrid RAG System

A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines dense semantic search, sparse keyword matching, and metadata boosting with fine-tuning capabilities

## Overview

This system implements a hybrid retrieval approach that:
- Uses dense embeddings (Sentence Transformers) for semantic similarity
- Applies sparse TF-IDF vectors for keyword matching
- Incorporates metadata boosting based on dataset details
- **Neural Fusion**: Automatically learns optimal combination weights using contrastive learning
- Fine-tunes the semantic encoder using synthetic query-document pairs
- Evaluates performance using [BEIR methodology](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/rag/blob/main/benchmarks/llama-stack-rag-with-beir/benchmark_beir_ls_vs_no_ls.py)

## Architecture

The pipeline consists of six main stages:

1. **Data Processing**: Downloads and processes academic papers from S2ORC dataset
2. **Base Embedding Generation**: Creates dense embeddings and TF-IDF vectors
3. **Model Fine-tuning**: Trains the encoder using query-document pairs
4. **Fine-tuned Embedding Generation**: Creates embeddings with the improved model
5. **Neural Fusion Weight Learning**: Uses contrastive learning to discover optimal combination weights
6. **Evaluation**: Compares base vs fine-tuned performance using standard metrics

## Quick Start

### Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

This runs the complete pipeline using settings from `config.yaml`.

### Configuration

You can customize the encoder, neural fusion settings, and fine-tuning parameters by editing `config.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  encoder: "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"  # Any Sentence Transformers model
  device: "auto"

neural_fusion:
  learning_rate: 0.001 # Learning rate for weight optimization
  epochs: 100          # Training epochs for weight learning
  batch_size: 64       # Batch size for contrastive learning

finetune:
  max_pairs: 50000     # Number of training pairs
  epochs: 1            # Training epochs
  batch_size: 32       # Batch size for training
```

**Note**: The dataset configuration is currently fixed to `leminda-ai/s2orc_small` since the metadata boosting schema is not yet dynamic and only supports this specific dataset format.

## Components

### Dense Retrieval

Uses Sentence Transformers to create semantic embeddings that capture the meaning and context of documents. This component excels at finding conceptually similar content even when exact keywords don't match.

### Sparse Retrieval

Applies TF-IDF vectorization for traditional keyword-based matching. This component ensures that documents containing specific terms mentioned in the query are properly ranked and retrieved.

### Metadata Boosting

Enhances retrieval scores based on document metadata such as publication year, venue, authors, and field of study. Documents matching user preferences receive higher rankings in the final results.

### Fusion Weight Learning

Uses contrastive learning to automatically discover optimal combination weights for dense, sparse, and boost scores. The system learns from positive query-document pairs and randomly sampled negatives to find weights that best discriminate between relevant and irrelevant documents.

### Fine-tuning

The system uses contrastive learning with automatically generated query-document pairs from the dataset. Training queries include metadata context (venue, year, authors, field) to improve retrieval performance.

## Evaluation

The system uses BEIR methodology with standard metrics:

- **MAP@k**: Mean Average Precision
- **NDCG@k**: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
- **Statistical significance testing** using permutation tests

## How to use

Check out the how_to_use/ folder for examples. The notebook shows how to use the retrieval system with code examples.

## Notes

This implementation performs well in evaluation, which is different from the main branch evaluation. Here we generate pairs from the `generate_pairs.py` file in a way that mimics human-like queries by hardcoding certain queries with various patterns. It performs significantly better than the base model according to the evaluation and the `how_to_use` notebook. If you train with real or AI-generated synthetic data, it would certainly make the model more accurate. This is just an example to show that it works.
