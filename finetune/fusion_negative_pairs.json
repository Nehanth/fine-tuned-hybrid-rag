The sample was composed of 2,361 adolescents aged 14\u201319 years (56.6% female). Physical activity was measured using a questionnaire and environmental (perceived environmental characteristics) and psychosocial (self-efficacy, social support from parents and friends for physical activity) factors with previously validated scales. Perceived environmental characteristics were not directly associated with the levels of physical activity, but exhibited significant indirect associations, mediated by self-efficacy in males. Self-efficacy and social support were positively and directly associated with physical activity levels, and part of the associations between social support and physical activity was mediated by self-efficacy. Perception of self-efficacy and social support, important factors associated with physical activity levels in adolescents, should be the target of interventions aimed at increasing physical activity.

From these segments, keyphrases are generated using the KPMiner keyphrase extraction system. These keyphrases and segments are then used in generating queries indicative of the segment, and consequently the document. The queries are submitted to ChatNoir for finding plagiarism sources in the ClueWeb09 corpus from which the pan13 dataset is plagiarized. The target is to lessen the overall search effort while maximizing the performance by scoring unconsumed queries against the already downloaded candidate sources.

Poor quality medicines have important health consequences, including the potential for treatment failure, development of antimicrobial resistance, and serious adverse drug reactions, increasing healthcare costs and undermining the public's confidence in healthcare systems. This article presents a review of the methods employed for the analysis of pharmaceutical formulations. Technologies for detecting substandard and falsified drugs were identified primarily through literature reviews. Key-informant interviews with experts augmented our methods when warranted. In order to aid comparisons, technologies were assigned a suitability score for use in LMIC ranging from 0\u20138. Scores measured the need for electricity, need for sample preparation, need for reagents, portability, level of training required, and speed of analysis. Technologies with higher scores were deemed the most feasible in LMICs. We categorized technologies that cost $10,000 USD or less as low cost, $10,000\u2013100,000 USD as medium cost and those greater than $100,000 USD as high cost technologies (all prices are 2013 USD). This search strategy yielded information on 42 unique technologies. Five technologies were deemed both low cost and had feasibility scores between 6\u20138, and an additional four technologies had medium cost and high feasibility.

PURPOSE\nPatients with cancer frequently use herbal supplements and concomitant medications along with antineoplastic agents. These patients are at high risk of herb-drug interactions (HDIs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We aimed to determine clinically relevant DDIs and HDIs leading to pharmaceutical intervention.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients starting a new anticancer therapy were asked to complete a questionnaire to identify concomitant use of any over-the-counter drug or herbal supplement. Potential DDIs and HDIs were identified using two different databases. If a potentially clinically relevant DDI was recognized by the clinical pharmacist, a notification was sent to the prescribing oncologist, who decided whether to carry out a suggested intervention. Regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with clinically relevant DDIs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 149 patients were included in this study, with 36 potentially clinically relevant DDIs identified in 26 patients (17.4%; 95% CI, 11.3% to 23.5%), all of them leading to therapy modifications. In total, four patients (2.7%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 5.3%) had experienced clinical consequences from DDIs at the time of pharmacist notification. Additionally, 84 patients (56.4%; 95% CI, 48.4% to 64.4%) reported using concurrent herbal supplements, and 122 possible HDIs were detected. Concomitant use of two or more drugs was independently associated with high risk of a clinically significant DDI (odds ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.08 to 5.91; P = .03).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPotentially clinically relevant DDIs and possible HDIs were frequently detected in this prospective study. A multidisciplinary approach is required to identify and avoid potentially harmful combinations with anticancer therapy."

This paper reports one of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) contributions to AREP. It compares performance of alternative refrigerants to that of R-410A and R-404A for heat pump and medium temperature applications, respectively. The alternatives reported in this paper are: R-32, DR-5, and L-41a for R-410A and ARM-31a, D2Y-65, L-40, and a mixture of R-32 and R-134a for R-404A. All performance comparison tests were conducted using scroll compressors of ~1.85 tons (6.5 kW) cooling capacity. Tests were conducted over a range of combinations of saturation suction and saturation discharge temperatures for both compressors. The tests showed that, in general, energy efficiency ratio (EER) and cooling capacity of R-410A alternative refrigerants were slightly lower than that of the baseline refrigerant with a moderate increases in discharge temperature. On the other hand, R-404A alternative refrigerants showed relative performance dependence on saturation suction and saturation discharge temperatures and larger increasesmore\u00bb in discharge temperature than for the R-410A alternatives. This paper summarizes the relative performance of all alternative refrigerants compared to their respective baseline.\u00abless"

(1) Is it true that good jobs in Hungary can be obtained through friends and relatives? (2) Why do personal connections help people to get a good job? The theoretical part of the book is concerned with the second question. A distinction is made between two mechanisms that might generate contact effects: particularism (personal contacts push employers towards hiring a friend instead of other applicants) and intensive search (contacts reduce the uncertainty of employers with respect to the abilities of applicants). After a comprehensive review of existing theories, hypotheses are derived in order to disentangle these mechanisms. The first reseach question and the hypotheses are examined using a rather unique data set about young job seekers who completed secondary vocational education in 1998. The findings are the following. First, personal contacts help people to find good jobs. It is found that both high status contacts and employee referrals are helpful to find jobs in firms and occupations which are likely to provide long-term earning advantages. Additionally, high status contacts inform job seekers about opportunities that are associated with better earnings opportunities, and employee referrals increase the chances of keeping the job. Second, network resources do not have an influence on the chances of finding a job through high status persons or employee referrals, thus inequalities in network resources do not contribute to actual earnings inequalities. Finally, evidence does not support our hypotheses that would discriminate between the particularism and the intensive search mechanisms. Therefore it remains unknown why good jobs can be accessed through high status contacts and employee referrals."

Phosphatase and tensin homolog located on chromosome 10q23 (PTEN) is inactivated in a subset and AKT is frequently activated in cancer. The PTEN is the central negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling cascade that influences multiple cellular functions including cell growth, survival, proliferation and migration in a context-dependent manner. Dysregulation of this signaling pathway contributes to different types of cancers. The objective of the study is to explore the anti-cancer potential of thymoquinone (TQ) by analyzing the interaction between TQ with the target protein PTEN. Methods: The three dimensional structure of TQ is designed using in-silico methods, and the structure of PTEN is obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information against protein data bank. The query sequence from 8 to 353 amino acids was found to be 85% homologous to ID5R. For the target protein PTEN with 403 residues, protein families analysis covered the important domains in PTEN. Result: TQ showed the binding energy of \u22127.37 Kcal/mol against PTEN with three hydrogen bonds. Conclusion: Present study suggests that TQ might inhibit abnormal cell proliferation occurring in cancer by modulating the activity of PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT pathway. Keywords: Cancer, Thymoquinone, Phosphatase and tensin homolog located on chromosome 10q23, Docking and hydrogen bonds."

The secondary impurity phases of Fe 2 O 3 and ZnO slowly disappeared with annealing temperature up to 800\u00b0C. But, there are some FeSiO 3 , Zn 2 SiO 4 and SiO 2 impurity phases formation when the annealing temperature is 900\u00b0C. The average grain size and surface roughness increased with annealing temperature up to 800\u00b0C and then they decreased at 900\u00b0C. The saturation magnetization gradually increases with annealing temperature up to 800\u00b0C and then it decreases at 900\u00b0C. Meanwhile, the coercivity monotonically decreases with annealing temperature up to 900\u00b0C."

Proximal humeral fractures are complex lesions with difficult management problems; therefore, they pose a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. In the literature, numerous treatment techniques have been proposed for these kinds of fractures. In our study we reviewed 30 patients with a mean age of 75 years presenting a proximal humeral fracture (Neer 2-3) and treated at our clinic with a Polarus nail, with a mean follow-up of 7 years. We obtained 73.3% of good and excellent results in line with literature. Complications were recorded in 6 of the patients (20%) recruited in our study. In particular, 3 cases of proximal screw pull-out, 1 case of deep infection and 2 cases of acromio-clavicular joint impingement syndrome. The aim of our study was to review our case histories and compare them with the literature analysing this complex type fracture and treatment options."

In the future, the use of imaging methods to quantify the progression and regression of atherosclerosis could play a strong role in the management of patients. High-resolution, noninvasive MRI may provide exhaustive 3-D anatomic information about the lumen and the vessel wall. Furthermore, MRI has the ability to characterize plaque composition and microanatomy and therefore to identify lesions vulnerable to rupture or erosion. The high resolution of MRI and the development of sophisticated contrast agents offer the promise of molecular in vivo molecular imaging of the plaque. This may aid early intervention (e.g., lipid lowering drug regiments) in both primary and secondary treatment of vascular disease in all arterial beds."

Methods We enrolled 41 Taiwanese non-syndromic deafness patients with CI that lacked known mutations in common deafness genes. All probands were screened by a targeted exon amplification method that used massively parallel sequencing to screen a customized panel that included 40 relatively rare non-syndromic deafness genes. Results Thirteen candidate variants in nine relatively rare deafness genes (MYO15A, TMC1, MYH14, MYO3A, ACTG1, COL11A2, DSPP, GRHL2, and WFS1) were identified in 24.4% (10/41) of the non-syndromic deafness probands with CI. According to the ACMG Standards and Guidelines, five variants in MYO15A and ACTG1 were classified as likely pathogenic variants. Two of three multi-generational pedigrees exhibiting deafness were analyzed for the segregation of the disorder with the possible disease-causing variants. Patients with variants detected in most of the identified variant-bearing genes showed relatively good CI outcomes. Conclusions We successfully identified candidate variants in partially deaf Taiwanese probands who lacked the known mutations in common deafness genes. Comparing the progress of hearing rehabilitation in CI patients with their apparent causative variants and the expression profiles of their altered genes allowed us to speculate on how alterations in specific gene sets may influence outcomes in hearing rehabilitation after CI."

    "document": "Possible effects of normetabolites on the subjective and reinforcing characteristics of opioids in animals and man. When an opioid capable of forming active metabolites is administered, the total pharmacology is the result of interactions of the opioid and such metabolites, especially normetabolites. Normetabolites may affect the morphine-like characteristics of certain opioids and thus influence their reinforcement in animals and man. Most opioids, when administered in single doses, are positively reinforcing in addicts. Oral administration, as compared with parenteral, facilitates the formation of normetabolites. When chronically administered, many opioids, including acetylmethadol, meperidine, morphine, codeine, propoxyphene, and levorphanol, show evidence of a longer half-life for their normetabolites. Normetabolites may have aversive characteristics and thus impair positive reinforcement of the parent drug in animals and man. For example, addicts do not like chronic oral morphine or chronic oral codeine. Conversely, methadone, the normetabolites of which are inactive, is well accepted during chronic oral administration. Drugs which inhibit N-demethylation will increase the agonist potency of opioids having inactive normetabolites (e.g., methadone) but will decrease the agonist potency of opioids having more potent normetabolites than the parent (e.g., acetylmethadol). The divergent responses of addicts to single doses of opiates as compared with chronic doses indicate that chronic addiction tests in man are needed befored relative abuse liability can be predicted."

Case Studies of Hospital Pharmacy Automation in Canada and France Automated medication dispensing systems for hospital pharmacies, heralded as an important means of reducing drug errors and improving labor productivity, have also been seen as a means of furthering the transformation of the pharmacy profession from its role in dispensing prescriptions to a clinical profession concerned with treatments and patient outcomes. Automation aids this transformation by transferring the responsibility for routine dispensing to technicians performing rationalized and computer-mediated tasks. Not all pharmacists agree with these trends. Some fear a loss of professional status and employment as their knowledge is expropriated and incorporated into machinery operated by those with lesser qualifications. They fear an industrial rather than a clinical future. Their concerns are compounded by health care cutbacks. These issues were studied at two hospitals in Canada and one in France, all mid-sized public hospitals with automated unit dose drug delivery systems installed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Preliminary results indicated national differences in approaches to hospital pharmacy automation. In Canada, pharmacists have resisted major changes in their control of the dispensing process and in their traditional roles vis \u00e0 vis doctors and pharmacy technicians. In France, where hospital pharmacy as a profession is less developed than in North America, automation has brought about a far more radical substitution for pharmacists' labor."

Results show that dibutyrylcGMP, the cGMP analogue, and sodium nitroprusside, the guanylyl cyclase activator, had no effect on the luminescence of O. aranea and O. californica. On the other hand, cGMP could be involved in an inhibitory control in A. filiformis. Dibutyryl-cAMP, the cAMP analogue, and forskolin, the adenylyl cyclase activator, had no effect on maximal light emission, but the adenylyl cyclase inhibitors MDL-12,330A and SQ22,536 affected the kinetics of light production in both Ophiopsila species and strongly reduced KCl-induced luminescence in A. filiformis and O. aranea, suggesting cAMP pathway involvement in photogenesis. The phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 also strongly reduced KCl-induced luminescence in all three species but this effect seems to be unspecific since U-73343, the inactive analogue of U-73122, equally inhibited photogenesis. Therefore, the results suggest that luminescence control of A. filiformis, O. aranea and O. californica is mediated by cAMP in synergy with calcium."

In general, the structure of top layer is usually single discrete blocks, typically accropode blocks, four-leg square hollow blocks and barrier boards, and also acropode, riprap, paved rock blocks or concrete slabs with smaller waves. Such top layer has been provided with many research findings on its stability and is widely used in engineering. Setting a filter layer between the top layer and the lower dike core mainly has two functions: (1) giving certain permeability, to minimize the hydrodynamic load directly acting on the lower foundation soil; (2) giving certain hydraulic tightness, to prevent fine sediment of the lower foundation soil from being washed out. This paper is focused on a special filter layer with geotextile as its upper structure and coarse aggregate as its lower structure. By simulating geotextile with different permeability and coarse aggregate with different size, the pressure of top of cover layer and the down side of the geotextile is tested under wave actions, and compared with theoretical analysis, in this way, how the permeability of geotextile impacts the stability of top layer is studied. The research shows that when the filter layer under the geotextile has high permeability and the geotextile's permeability gets poorer, the uplift force to geotextile and the top layer will be increased under wave action, which will cause damage to the top layer when it is greater than the vertical component of the underwater gravity along the slope surface."

Plate count was used to determine the relative proportion of different types of microbes in the sample, either as bacteria, fungi or yeast. The samples were serially diluted and the dilutions (10 10) were plated on selective media. Microbial isolates showed high bacterial population compared to normal soil population. Eight (8) bacterial isolates as pure culture were relatively the dominant microbes with population ranging from (1.4 x 10 to 5.5 x 10 CFU/g). Bacterial and fungal isolates exhibited distinctive cultural characteristics (color, shape, colony size (mm), texture, elevation, appearance, optical property). Based on the findings of this present investigation, the authors concludes that useful potential bacteria and fungi as indigenous microorganism can be collected from bamboo forest in Alfonso Lista, Ifugao Philippines which can be isolated and used for further studies on bioconversion of farm waste into organic fertilizer."
