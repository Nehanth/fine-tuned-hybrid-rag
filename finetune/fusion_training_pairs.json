    "document": "Clinical or Industrial Pharmacy? Case Studies of Hospital Pharmacy Automation in Canada and France Automated medication dispensing systems for hospital pharmacies, heralded as an important means of reducing drug errors and improving labor productivity, have also been seen as a means of furthering the transformation of the pharmacy profession from its role in dispensing prescriptions to a clinical profession concerned with treatments and patient outcomes. Automation aids this transformation by transferring the responsibility for routine dispensing to technicians performing rationalized and computer-mediated tasks. Not all pharmacists agree with these trends. Some fear a loss of professional status and employment as their knowledge is expropriated and incorporated into machinery operated by those with lesser qualifications. They fear an industrial rather than a clinical future. Their concerns are compounded by health care cutbacks. These issues were studied at two hospitals in Canada and one in France, all mid-sized public hospitals with automated unit dose drug delivery systems installed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Preliminary results indicated national differences in approaches to hospital pharmacy automation. In Canada, pharmacists have resisted major changes in their control of the dispensing process and in their traditional roles vis à vis doctors and pharmacy technicians. In France, where hospital pharmacy as a profession is less developed than in North America, automation has brought about a far more radical substitution for pharmacists' labor."

    "document": "Noncoronary and coronary atherothrombotic plaque imaging and monitoring of therapy by MRI. In the future, the use of imaging methods to quantify the progression and regression of atherosclerosis could play a strong role in the management of patients. High-resolution, noninvasive MRI may provide exhaustive 3-D anatomic information about the lumen and the vessel wall. Furthermore, MRI has the ability to characterize plaque composition and microanatomy and therefore to identify lesions vulnerable to rupture or erosion. The high resolution of MRI and the development of sophisticated contrast agents offer the promise of molecular in vivo molecular imaging of the plaque. This may aid early intervention (e.g., lipid lowering drug regiments) in both primary and secondary treatment of vascular disease in all arterial beds."

    "document": "Fully convolutional architecture vs sliding-window CNN for corneal endothelium cell segmentation BackgroundCorneal endothelium (CE) images provide valuable clinical information regarding the health state of the cornea. Computation of the clinical morphometric parameters requires the segmentation of endothelial cell images. Current techniques to image the endothelium in vivo deliver low quality images, which makes automatic segmentation a complicated task. Here, we present two convolutional neural networks (CNN) to segment CE images: a global fully convolutional approach based on U-net, and a local sliding-window network (SW-net). We propose to use probabilistic labels instead of binary, we evaluate a preprocessing method to enhance the contrast of images, and we introduce a postprocessing method based on Fourier analysis and watershed to convert the CNN output images into the final cell segmentation. Both methods are applied to 50 images acquired with an SP-1P Topcon specular microscope. Estimates are compared against a manual delineation made by a trained observer.ResultsU-net (AUC=0.9938) yields slightly sharper, clearer images than SW-net (AUC=0.9921). After postprocessing, U-net obtains a DICE=0.981 and a MHD=0.22 (modified Hausdorff distance), whereas SW-net yields a DICE=0.978 and a MHD=0.30. U-net generates a wrong cell segmentation in only 0.48% of the cells, versus 0.92% for the SW-net. U-net achieves statistically significant better precision and accuracy than both, Topcon and SW-net, for the estimates of three clinical parameters: cell density (ECD), polymegethism (CV), and pleomorphism (HEX). The mean relative error in U-net for the parameters is 0.4% in ECD, 2.8% in CV, and 1.3% in HEX. The computation time to segment an image and estimate the parameters is barely a few seconds.ConclusionsBoth methods presented here provide a statistically significant improvement over the state of the art. U-net has reached the smallest error rate. We suggest a segmentation refinement based on our previous work to further improve the performance."

Poor quality medicines have important health consequences, including the potential for treatment failure, development of antimicrobial resistance, and serious adverse drug reactions, increasing healthcare costs and undermining the public's confidence in healthcare systems. This article presents a review of the methods employed for the analysis of pharmaceutical formulations. Technologies for detecting substandard and falsified drugs were identified primarily through literature reviews. Key-informant interviews with experts augmented our methods when warranted. In order to aid comparisons, technologies were assigned a suitability score for use in LMIC ranging from 0–8. Scores measured the need for electricity, need for sample preparation, need for reagents, portability, level of training required, and speed of analysis. Technologies with higher scores were deemed the most feasible in LMICs. We categorized technologies that cost $10,000 USD or less as low cost, $10,000–100,000 USD as medium cost and those greater than $100,000 USD as high cost technologies (all prices are 2013 USD). This search strategy yielded information on 42 unique technologies. Five technologies were deemed both low cost and had feasibility scores between 6–8, and an additional four technologies had medium cost and high feasibility. Twelve technologies were deemed portable and therefore could be used in the field. Many technologies can aid in the detection of substandard and falsified drugs that vary from the simplest of checklists for packaging to the most complex mass spectrometry analyses. Although there is no single technology that can serve all the requirements of detecting falsified and substandard drugs, there is an opportunity to bifurcate the technologies into specific niches to address specific sections within the workflow process of detecting products."

Methods We enrolled 41 Taiwanese non-syndromic deafness patients with CI that lacked known mutations in common deafness genes. All probands were screened by a targeted exon amplification method that used massively parallel sequencing to screen a customized panel that included 40 relatively rare non-syndromic deafness genes. Results Thirteen candidate variants in nine relatively rare deafness genes (MYO15A, TMC1, MYH14, MYO3A, ACTG1, COL11A2, DSPP, GRHL2, and WFS1) were identified in 24.4% (10/41) of the non-syndromic deafness probands with CI. According to the ACMG Standards and Guidelines, five variants in MYO15A and ACTG1 were classified as likely pathogenic variants. Two of three multi-generational pedigrees exhibiting deafness were analyzed for the segregation of the disorder with the possible disease-causing variants. Patients with variants detected in most of the identified variant-bearing genes showed relatively good CI outcomes. Conclusions We successfully identified candidate variants in partially deaf Taiwanese probands who lacked the known mutations in common deafness genes. Comparing the progress of hearing rehabilitation in CI patients with their apparent causative variants and the expression profiles of their altered genes allowed us to speculate on how alterations in specific gene sets may influence outcomes in hearing rehabilitation after CI."

The phenotype is very heterogeneous and includes polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, typically involving the facial skull, numerous café-au-lait spots and autonomous hyperfunctions of several endocrine systems, leading to hyperthyroidism, hypercortisolism, precocious puberty and acromegaly.Case presentationHere, we describe a 12-year-old Caucasian girl with severe facial involvement of fibrous dysplasia, along with massive acromegaly due to growth hormone excess and precocious puberty, with a prolactinoma. Our patient was treated with a bisphosphonate and the prolactin antagonist, cabergoline, resulting in the inhibition of fibrous dysplasia and involution of both the prolactinoma and growth hormone excess. During a follow-up of more than two years, no severe side effects were noted.ConclusionTreatment with bisphosphonates in combination with cabergoline is a suitable option in patients with McCune-Albright syndrome, especially in order to circumvent surgical interventions in patients suffering from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia involving the skull base."

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Evaluation of outcome after surgical treatment of humerus metastases with a focus on tumour and patient derived factors, timing and strategy of intervention, surgical outcome and complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-fie patients with a mean age of 64.3 years (range 25-89) with 66 metastases of the humerus were surgically treated in a 7-year time-period and retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer were the most abundant types of primary tumour. The mean time from diagnosis of primary tumour to fist metastasis was 14.5 months (range 0-173). The mean time from diagnosis of metastasis to surgery was 21.4 months (range 0-173). 38/28 intramedullary nails/locking plates were used for 58/8 manifest/impending pathological fractures. Mean cumulative survival was 16.3 months and implant failure rate was 6.1% with a mean time from initial surgery to revision of 22.2-20.6 months. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that treatment with intramedullary fiation or cement augmented plate osteosynthesis is successful for the vast majority of patients, but thorough clinical evaluation and precise decision making adapted to the patient's estimated life expectancy must be applied to avoid overtreatment or risk of implant failure.

Mounted on the 2.1m Viper telescope, ACBAR has dedicated four years to cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations at the South Pole. We describe the focal plane reconstruction and performance of ACBAR for the 2005 austral winter. We present a new CMB temperature anisotropy power spectrum for the complete ACBAR data set. The addition of data from the 2005 observing season expands the data set by 210%; and the sky coverage by 490%; over the previous ACBAR releases. The expanded data set allows us to derive a new set of band-power measurements with finer [italic l]-resolution and dramatically smaller uncertainties. In particular, the band-power uncertainties have been reduced by more than a factor of two on angular scales encompassing the third and fourth acoustic peaks and the damping tail of the CMB power spectrum. The calibration has been significantly improved from 6%; to 2.2%; in temperature by using a direct comparison between CMB anisotropy maps measured by WMAP3 and ACBAR to transfer the WMAP dipole-based calibration to ACBAR. The resulting power spectrum is consistent with theoretical predications for a spatially flat, dark energy-dominated Lambda CDM cosmology."

Also, children spend increasingly more time in situations with (many) other children, such as in day care institutions and kindergartens, with high noise levels due to a com-bination of loud voices, loud toys, and bad acoustics. In an unknown percentage of households, nowadays television or audio-equipment is turned on for the whole day, thus creating an ever-lasting noisy environment for the child. Children may be more annoyed or otherwise adversely affected by noise than adults, in part because they possess less well-developed coping responses, and are often less able to control their environments.

Owing to the small number of cases, it is not clear from the currently available publications whether spirochetes colonizing the colorectal mucosa are harmless commensals or pathogenic organisms. Furthermore, the reported complaints of these patients cannot be pooled to identify a characteristic complex of symptoms. The aim of the present work was to describe the symptoms associated with intestinal spirochetosis in a population of 209 patients, and to elucidate the effect of antibiotic treatment on these symptoms. Material and methods. A total of 209 carefully processed questionnaires providing information on the symptoms, treatment and post-treatment symptoms of patients with spirochetosis were evaluated statistically and descriptively with the aid of the SPSS program, and the results were compared with those reported in the currently available literature. Results. Of the 209 patients 168 (80.4%) were males, and the average age of the entire population at establishment of the diagnosis was 50.75 years. The most common symptoms reported were abdominal pain (46%), diarrhoea (51%) and alternating diarrhoea and constipation (13%). In this population, homosexuality and HIV infection played only a small role (6.5% homosexual patients, 3.8% HIV infected). In 72 of the 84 patients who received treatment (86%), the antibiotic employed was metronidazole, and the symptoms improved in 44 of the 84 patients (5%). Twenty-six of the 84 patients (30.9%) were investigated by colonoscopy/biopsy after receiving medical treatment. Biopsies in 20 of these patients no longer revealed infection with spirochetes, and symptoms were found to have improved in 11 of the 20 patients (55%). Conclusions. If intestinal spirochetosis is diagnosed to be the sole intestinal pathology in symptomatic patients, the bacteria should be eradicated with metronidazole and a colonoscopy/biopsy follow-up performed, where indicated, in patients with persisting symptoms. Significant results regarding symptoms and treatment of intestinal spirochetosis can be achieved only in a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study. In view of the low prevalence of this condition, such a study is difficult to implement."

We construct a stage threshold pattern whereby the final stage threshold exceeds the early stage threshold due to drift differentials between the project values at the various stages, value volatility differences, and correlation differentials, implying a rich menu of parameter values that may be suitable for a variety of projects. Governments seeking to motivate early final stage investments might lower final stage project volatility or specify project value decline over time, unless prospective owners are willing to pay the real option value (ROV) for concessions. In contrast, concession owners, more interested in ROV than thresholds that motivate early investments, may welcome final stage value escalation, or guarantees that reduce the correlation between project value and construction cost."

The global stability of the model is analyzed in terms of two threshold parameters, namely, basic reproduction number, R 0 and immune response reproduction number, R 1 . The obtained results signify that the infection dies out if R 0 ≤ 1 and persists if R 0 > 1 . We establish that the global dynamic behavior of the model has no concern with the efficacy of the nonlytic component. Numerical simulations are performed to support our theoretical findings and to investigate the effects of lytic and nonlytic components on the viral dynamics model. A comparison of two different viral infection models has been performed to illustrate the effect of viral replication inhibition through nonlytic effector mechanism on the infection dynamics. Moreover, a case study of HIV-1 infected humanized mice is presented and the result manifests that the model can fairly demonstrate the chronic stage of HIV-1 infection in humanized mice."

The Swedish Volunteer Corps took part in the Soviet-Finnish War of 1939-1940 on Finland's side. Centuries of being part of the kingdom of Sweden is the reason for the close connection between Finland and Sweden both during the reign of Russian emperors and after winning the independence from Russia in December 1917. Finland remained an important political partner of Sweden and a country-next-door in the mass consciousness of the population. Having opened the recruiting centre in central Stockholm on the first day of the SovietFinnish War, the Swedish government concluded, that the volunteers did not break the state's neutral status, and allowed placing the recruiting posters on public transport. By January 1940, there were as many as 120+ recruitment points in Sweden. The Swedish Volunteer Corps included representatives of all strata of the Swedish society. But there were few professional soldiers or people who had experience of military service among the volunteers. Only a minor part of the volunteers were trained enough to fight in difficult winterconditions. Despite the fact that short duration of this war opposed the Swedish Volunteer Corps to be most vividly in evidence in the course of battling, it became a symbol of a special, very close relationship between Sweden and Finland. It influenced the culture of both Nordic countries because it were the Swedish volunteers who constituted the vast majority of the foreign volunteers' total number taking part in the SovietFinnish War of 1939-1940 on Finland's side."

(1) Is it true that good jobs in Hungary can be obtained through friends and relatives? (2) Why do personal connections help people to get a good job? The theoretical part of the book is concerned with the second question. A distinction is made between two mechanisms that might generate contact effects: particularism (personal contacts push employers towards hiring a friend instead of other applicants) and intensive search (contacts reduce the uncertainty of employers with respect to the abilities of applicants). After a comprehensive review of existing theories, hypotheses are derived in order to disentangle these mechanisms. The first reseach question and the hypotheses are examined using a rather unique data set about young job seekers who completed secondary vocational education in 1998. The findings are the following. First, personal contacts help people to find good jobs. It is found that both high status contacts and employee referrals are helpful to find jobs in firms and occupations which are likely to provide long-term earning advantages. Additionally, high status contacts inform job seekers about opportunities that are associated with better earnings opportunities, and employee referrals increase the chances of keeping the job. Second, network resources do not have an influence on the chances of finding a job through high status persons or employee referrals, thus inequalities in network resources do not contribute to actual earnings inequalities. Finally, evidence does not support our hypotheses that would discriminate between the particularism and the intensive search mechanisms. Therefore it remains unknown why good jobs can be accessed through high status contacts and employee referrals."

The sample was composed of 2,361 adolescents aged 14–19 years (56.6% female). Physical activity was measured using a questionnaire and environmental (perceived environmental characteristics) and psychosocial (self-efficacy, social support from parents and friends for physical activity) factors with previously validated scales. Perceived environmental characteristics were not directly associated with the levels of physical activity, but exhibited significant indirect associations, mediated by self-efficacy in males. Self-efficacy and social support were positively and directly associated with physical activity levels, and part of the associations between social support and physical activity was mediated by self-efficacy. Perception of self-efficacy and social support, important factors associated with physical activity levels in adolescents, should be the target of interventions aimed at increasing physical activity. Favorable environments for physical activity also need to be considered, since they have a positive influence on the self-efficacy of adolescents."

Students today are growing up with the Internet, and this has impacted on how they live and learn. Therefore, \nteachers can no longer rely solely on traditional pedagogy in English language instruction. More engaging \ntechniques are needed to motivate learning. In English-as-Second-Language (ESL) contexts, students are \noften reluctant to write in English. Their reluctance can be attributed to the lack of a real or compelling \nreason to write, the absence of complementary support besides the teacher-fronted classroom, and the \nignorance of interesting writing tools. Yet writing in English is an essential skill for students to succeed in their \nacademic endeavours and later in their career. This observation instigated the present study to investigate \nthe applicability of wiki for the teaching and learning of English, focusing especially on writing. This study \nexplored the application of a Writing With Wiki (WWW) approach in both secondary and tertiary contexts \nwhere students were trained to use a Wiki tool to collaboratively write subject-related materials. The task \nmotivated the students to write as they appreciated the authentic purpose of their writing.

    "document": "Possible effects of normetabolites on the subjective and reinforcing characteristics of opioids in animals and man. When an opioid capable of forming active metabolites is administered, the total pharmacology is the result of interactions of the opioid and such metabolites, especially normetabolites. Normetabolites may affect the morphine-like characteristics of certain opioids and thus influence their reinforcement in animals and man. Most opioids, when administered in single doses, are positively reinforcing in addicts. Oral administration, as compared with parenteral, facilitates the formation of normetabolites. When chronically administered, many opioids, including acetylmethadol, meperidine, morphine, codeine, propoxyphene, and levorphanol, show evidence of a longer half-life for their normetabolites. Normetabolites may have aversive characteristics and thus impair positive reinforcement of the parent drug in animals and man. For example, addicts do not like chronic oral morphine or chronic oral codeine. Conversely, methadone, the normetabolites of which are inactive, is well accepted during chronic oral administration. Drugs which inhibit N-demethylation will increase the agonist potency of opioids having inactive normetabolites (e.g., methadone) but will decrease the agonist potency of opioids having more potent normetabolites than the parent (e.g., acetylmethadol). The divergent responses of addicts to single doses of opiates as compared with chronic doses indicate that chronic addiction tests in man are needed befored relative abuse liability can be predicted."

Intensifiers are expressions that are functionally and distributionally comparable to non-argumental x-self in English (e.g., the king himself, or do the work oneself). Mandarin examples are zìjǐ, běnshēn, qīnzì, or qīnkǒu. The descriptive goal is to identify the paradigm of adnominal and agentive-adverbial intensifiers in Mandarin and to determine the individual conditions of their use. On the theoretical side, I apply the analysis of intensifiers as lexicalizations of the identity function first proposed for German to the Chinese case. The identity function takes referential DPs as arguments, or, in the agentive-adverbial use, the agentive Voice head. The identity function in itself is semantically inert, but if the intensifier is focused, alternatives to the identity function come into play. These alternatives are used to explain the contextualization patterns attested for intensifier sentences. Two competing approaches to Mandarin intensifiers are reviewed and found not to be sufficient to account for the data."

Rheological properties of the model slurries vary considerably with the neutralization degree α. Optical microscope and Turbiscan measurements show that the rheological change is accompanied by the change in particle aggregation tendency. Adsorption and zeta potential measurements reveal that α-dependent adsorption of poly(acrylic acid) is the key factor that controls the rheology of the slurries. The difference in α of the slurry results in a significant difference in the surface roughness and the carbon black particle distribution in the electrode. From this study, it is concluded that the adjustment of neutralization degree of poly(acrylic acid)-based binder critically affects the heterogeneity of the electrode, which can influence the performance as well as the rheological stability in the electrode manufacturing process."

This paper reports one of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) contributions to AREP. It compares performance of alternative refrigerants to that of R-410A and R-404A for heat pump and medium temperature applications, respectively. The alternatives reported in this paper are: R-32, DR-5, and L-41a for R-410A and ARM-31a, D2Y-65, L-40, and a mixture of R-32 and R-134a for R-404A. All performance comparison tests were conducted using scroll compressors of ~1.85 tons (6.5 kW) cooling capacity. Tests were conducted over a range of combinations of saturation suction and saturation discharge temperatures for both compressors. The tests showed that, in general, energy efficiency ratio (EER) and cooling capacity of R-410A alternative refrigerants were slightly lower than that of the baseline refrigerant with a moderate increases in discharge temperature.

Results show that dibutyrylcGMP, the cGMP analogue, and sodium nitroprusside, the guanylyl cyclase activator, had no effect on the luminescence of O. aranea and O. californica. On the other hand, cGMP could be involved in an inhibitory control in A. filiformis. Dibutyryl-cAMP, the cAMP analogue, and forskolin, the adenylyl cyclase activator, had no effect on maximal light emission, but the adenylyl cyclase inhibitors MDL-12,330A and SQ22,536 affected the kinetics of light production in both Ophiopsila species and strongly reduced KCl-induced luminescence in A. filiformis and O. aranea, suggesting cAMP pathway involvement in photogenesis. The phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 also strongly reduced KCl-induced luminescence in all three species but this effect seems to be unspecific since U-73343, the inactive analogue of U-73122, equally inhibited photogenesis. Therefore, the results suggest that luminescence control of A. filiformis, O. aranea and O. californica is mediated by cAMP in synergy with calcium."

HPAIV H5N1 also poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans. One effective way to combat avian influenza with pandemic potential is through the vaccination of poultry. Several live vaccines based on attenuated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that express influenza hemagglutinin (HA) have been developed to protect chickens or mammalian species against HPAIV. However, the zoonotic potential of NDV raises safety concerns regarding the use of live NDV recombinants, as the incorporation of a heterologous attachment protein may result in the generation of NDV with altered tropism and/or pathogenicity. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study we generated recombinant NDVs expressing either full length, membrane-anchored HA of the H5 subtype (NDV-H5) or a soluble trimeric form thereof (NDV-sH53). A single intramuscular immunization with NDV-sH53 or NDV-H5 fully protected chickens against disease after a lethal challenge with H5N1 and reduced levels of virus shedding in tracheal and cloacal swabs. NDV-sH53 was less protective than NDV-H5 (50% vs 80% protection) when administered via the respiratory tract. The NDV-sH53 was ineffective in mice, regardless of whether administered oculonasally or intramuscularly. In this species, NDV-H5 induced protective immunity against HPAIV H5N1, but only after oculonasal administration, despite the poor H5-specific serum antibody response it elicited. Conclusions/Significance Although NDV expressing membrane anchored H5 in general provided better protection than its counterpart expressing soluble H5, chickens could be fully protected against a lethal challenge with H5N1 by using the latter NDV vector. This study thus provides proof of concept for the use of recombinant vector vaccines expressing a soluble form of a heterologous viral membrane protein. Such vectors may be advantageous as they preclude the incorporation of heterologous membrane proteins into the viral vector particles."

PURPOSE\nPatients with cancer frequently use herbal supplements and concomitant medications along with antineoplastic agents. These patients are at high risk of herb-drug interactions (HDIs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We aimed to determine clinically relevant DDIs and HDIs leading to pharmaceutical intervention.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients starting a new anticancer therapy were asked to complete a questionnaire to identify concomitant use of any over-the-counter drug or herbal supplement. Potential DDIs and HDIs were identified using two different databases. If a potentially clinically relevant DDI was recognized by the clinical pharmacist, a notification was sent to the prescribing oncologist, who decided whether to carry out a suggested intervention. Regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with clinically relevant DDIs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 149 patients were included in this study, with 36 potentially clinically relevant DDIs identified in 26 patients (17.4%; 95% CI, 11.3% to 23.5%), all of them leading to therapy modifications. In total, four patients (2.7%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 5.3%) had experienced clinical consequences from DDIs at the time of pharmacist notification. Additionally, 84 patients (56.4%; 95% CI, 48.4% to 64.4%) reported using concurrent herbal supplements, and 122 possible HDIs were detected. Concomitant use of two or more drugs was independently associated with high risk of a clinically significant DDI (odds ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.08 to 5.91; P = .03).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPotentially clinically relevant DDIs and possible HDIs were frequently detected in this prospective study. A multidisciplinary approach is required to identify and avoid potentially harmful combinations with anticancer therapy."

The cylinders thus mediate the global transport of test particles between large zones of the energy surface which are separated by the bottlenecks.\n\nBy elucidating the structuring role of the cylinders, we provide a new language for discussing some important problems in celestial mechanics. Furthermore, we propose that these cylindrical structures are the natural objects of study for the design of space mission trajectories which take advantage of three-body effects."

In this problem of heat transfer involved the condition where different constructional parameters are changed for getting the performance review under different condition. An excel program has been developed for the ease of calculation and obtaining result after changing different parameters. The tube diameter, tube length, shell types etc. are all standardized and are available only in certain sizes and geometry. And so the design of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger usually involves a trial and error procedure where for a certain combination of the design variables the heat transfer area is calculated and then another combination is tried to check if there is any possibility of increasing the heat transfer coefficient. Since several discrete combinations of the design configurations are possible, the designer needs an efficient strategy to quickly locate the design configuration having the minimum heat exchanger cost. In this particular problem the tube metallurgy and baffle spacing are being changed the results are obtained. In current paper the baffle spacing and tube metallurgy are the parameters considering change and effect of the same of heat transfer coefficient have been considered."

In general, the structure of top layer is usually single discrete blocks, typically accropode blocks, four-leg square hollow blocks and barrier boards, and also acropode, riprap, paved rock blocks or concrete slabs with smaller waves. Such top layer has been provided with many research findings on its stability and is widely used in engineering. Setting a filter layer between the top layer and the lower dike core mainly has two functions: (1) giving certain permeability, to minimize the hydrodynamic load directly acting on the lower foundation soil; (2) giving certain hydraulic tightness, to prevent fine sediment of the lower foundation soil from being washed out. This paper is focused on a special filter layer with geotextile as its upper structure and coarse aggregate as its lower structure. By simulating geotextile with different permeability and coarse aggregate with different size, the pressure of top of cover layer and the down side of the geotextile is tested under wave actions, and compared with theoretical analysis, in this way, how the permeability of geotextile impacts the stability of top layer is studied. The research shows that when the filter layer under the geotextile has high permeability and the geotextile's permeability gets poorer, the uplift force to geotextile and the top layer will be increased under wave action, which will cause damage to the top layer when it is greater than the vertical component of the underwater gravity along the slope surface."

Phosphatase and tensin homolog located on chromosome 10q23 (PTEN) is inactivated in a subset and AKT is frequently activated in cancer. The PTEN is the central negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling cascade that influences multiple cellular functions including cell growth, survival, proliferation and migration in a context-dependent manner. Dysregulation of this signaling pathway contributes to different types of cancers. The objective of the study is to explore the anti-cancer potential of thymoquinone (TQ) by analyzing the interaction between TQ with the target protein PTEN. Methods: The three dimensional structure of TQ is designed using in-silico methods, and the structure of PTEN is obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information against protein data bank. The query sequence from 8 to 353 amino acids was found to be 85% homologous to ID5R. For the target protein PTEN with 403 residues, protein families analysis covered the important domains in PTEN. Result: TQ showed the binding energy of −7.37 Kcal/mol against PTEN with three hydrogen bonds. Conclusion: Present study suggests that TQ might inhibit abnormal cell proliferation occurring in cancer by modulating the activity of PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT pathway. Keywords: Cancer, Thymoquinone, Phosphatase and tensin homolog located on chromosome 10q23, Docking and hydrogen bonds."
