We use coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations to determine the effect of uniaxial strain on the stress, scission stress, and scission energy of solutions of wormlike micelles of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride/sodium salicylate (NaSal). We find that the breaking stress, stretch modulus, and scission energy of the charged micelles are nonmonotonic functions of oppositely charged hydrotrope (NaSal) concentration. The method and results can be used to predict the effects of flow and mechanical stress on rates of micellar breakage, which is important in the rheology of wormlike micellar solutions.",
